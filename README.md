The Kenya’s 1998 Demographic and Health Survey illustrates information on mortality of children that can assess needs of health of the population that are at high risk.  Mortality rates in children especially in third world countries, like Kenya, from 1984 have been increasing in post neonatal, infant, and overall, largely in children under five over the last 14 years. The fluctuating and increasing trends of for children mortality in Kenya, with influences of socioeconomic and biological inequalities in undeveloped counties, reflect the level of poverty and deprivation of a nation’s population.
